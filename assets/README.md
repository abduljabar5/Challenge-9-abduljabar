## Discription
This project was a little tricky, but what kept me motivated was the little challenges i had to overcome to complete this project. The purpose of this project was to create a README File generator. this was interesting becuase this was the first time working with node on a challenge. I did this so that creating readme files would become easier in the future. during this project I learned a few things like how to add a link in readme.
